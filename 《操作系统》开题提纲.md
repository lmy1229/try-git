! 《操作系统》选题：POSIX Networking API

* Introduction
  - Originated from Berkeley Sockets API.
  - Widely used in *nix and Windows.
  - Become part of the POSIX standard.
* Our Works
  + Plan A: Networking API
    - Simple Ethernet Drivers
    - Simple Data Link Layer
      (Now only bypass Internet data to driver, but can be extended to allow more complex network topology like VPN)
    - Simple IP Protocol Support (Static IP address)
    - Simple UDP Protocol Support
  + Plan B: Networking-like IPC API
    - Filesystem Enhancement (Add socket file type)
    - Simple Unix Domain Socket support (Using datagram)
* Potential Problems
  - How to implement socket and connection handle?
    (Standalone network handle / Anonymous inode in a "sockfs")
  - If we use "sockfs", do we need to add a socket filesystem and implement VFS in xv6?
  - Asynchronous I/O API? (Probably like epoll / kquque / IOCP?)
  - The need of "ioctl" system call?
* Current Progress
  - Userland C with a subset of standard C library (newlib-xv6)
  - Basic userland C++ (Without exception handling and RTTI; libXv6Cpp)
